    <h1>A Search for Identity: Navigating the Challenges of Adulthood</h1>
    <h2>“A Need for Purpose and Clarity in an Unpredictable World”</h2>

        What am I doing with my life?

God, I feel lost and confused, which is strange to me because at one point in my life I was beaming with confidence, an impenetrable force with a sense of purpose. Maybe it was a naïve and unrealistic dream, but I was striving for something and that’s what I miss, purpose. I’ve lost the prospect and now I wake up and sit at my computer, pathetically hacking away at a menial task that won’t get me anywhere in life. I regurgitate the lists, checking them off, yet still stuck in poverty. It’s due to “incorrigible laziness”, holy shit, I may be doomed.

So what can I proactively do to profoundly change my life, and make it structured and eventful? ‘Follow a said set of rules’, yes, it is that simple, but I tend to find myself slipping into the technical vice that strangles my focus. What if it’s the delusion of waking up, making coffee, having that fresh cup wafting into your nostrils, and imagining that I’m some writer, programmer, or “add a new title here”?

I do accomplish 98% of my daily list, and that’s a great feeling, a sense of relief, I’m also getting back into working out. As of now, twenty push-ups, a hundred sit-ups, lifting weights (185lbs), I need to go for mile runs in the morning. Before I move out of the country, I should go for those runs, and soak in the environment. The Oregon morning dew is therapeutic and it’s been awhile since I was outside, literally.

I need something to distract me and take my mind off of the British girl. I’m still in love and wondering if she once had a thought about me. I honestly regret my actions and how I treated her. She offered me a place to stay and was so kind. She was the greatest person I’ve ever met and cared for — a genuine woman. Ah, so it’s still those feelings eating away at me.

See, when everything started it came on too quick for me and I didn’t handle it well, in addition to losing the only other person I loved to suicide had me in a dense and gray place, and my British love was someone who pulled me out of my rut, and I don’t think she understands how much I appreciate her and what she has done for me and my life.

Still wishing, keep wishing, lots of fun wishing, I hope you reach out to me one day, and I hope the feeling’s mutual.
